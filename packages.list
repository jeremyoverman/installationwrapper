# This is the list of packages available to be installed.
#
# The name between brackets (i.e, [name]) is the unique identifier for each package.
#
# The following variables must be set for each package:
#
# name -- This is the name of the package as it appears in the GUI
# type -- This is the type of package that is being installed
# path -- This is path of the package being installed
#
# The following variables may optionally be set for each package:
#
# prerequisites -- Packages that must be installed before this package is installed.
#                 Note: This will *not* mark the package for installation. It will
#                 simply warn you if you try to install the package without the
#                 package marked for installation.
#
# Packages will be installed in the order that they are listed in this file regardless
# of the order that they are added to the "To be installed" list.
